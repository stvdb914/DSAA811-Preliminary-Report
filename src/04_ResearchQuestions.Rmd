opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#Read in the 4 csv files
athletes <- read.csv('./data/athlete_events_data_dictionary.csv', header = TRUE)
events <- read.csv('./data/athlete_events.csv', header = TRUE)
countryDefdd<- read.csv('./data/country_definitions_data_dictionary.csv',header = TRUE)
countryDef <- read.csv('./data/country_definitions.csv',header = TRUE)
glossaryDef <- data.frame(Acronym = character(), Meaning = character())
glossaryDef <- add_row(glossaryDef, Acronym = "NOC", Meaning = "National Olympic Committee")
```

As this is in the early stages of investigation, I still have too many questions to look into.

I can look at athletes, per winter or summer games, per country that the athlete competes at, or per NOC. I can even split the data into per sport. At the end of the day I want to answer, what is the minimal number of athletes that my country should send to the games to receive the most medals based on previous summer and winter Olympic data.

My plan moving forward is to play with the data set some more to see if I can marry the results of prior written research so I can stand on the giants of the past to push the research in this area forward in the future.
